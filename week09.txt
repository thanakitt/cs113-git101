Structure
-Collections of related varibles under one name.
-Varibles of may be of different data types.
-Members of the same structure types must have unique names, but two different structure types may contain members of the same name without conflict
Structure tag 
-The structure tag name is optional.
-If a structure definition does not contain a structure tag name, varibles of the structure type may be declared only in the structure definition-not in a seperate declaraiton
Self Reference 
-A structure cannot contain an instance of itself
-A varible of type struct employee cannot be declared in the definition for struct employee.
-A pointer to struct employee, may be include.
Storage in Memory
-Structures may not be compared using using operaators == and !=
-Computers may store specific data typee only on certain memory boundaries such as half-word, word or double-word boundaries.
-A word is a standard memory unit used to store data in a computer-usually 2 bytes or 4 bytes.
Storage in Memory
Initialization
-If there are fewer initializers in the list than membersin the structure
-Asignment State ment of same struct type
typedef
-The keyword typedef is a way to create synonyms (or aliases) for previously defined data types.
-Names for structure types are often defined with typedef to create shorter type names.
